Well that was fun! Now, to code.

this is going to drive me nuts

how the HELL do you change the 
font in this damned thing?!

ok! I don't hate it, and I THINK
it's different, which is totalaly
valid

ok, so the way i'm going to do 
this is to attach to a notificaiton
signal on focus change for EVERY
object and when it changes
change an object variable

sound simple enough? :D

one sec i need some dubstep
woo! ok, found my dubstep




I know it because I wrote every single 
line of this code
and this is the first time
i have referenced this signal in 
this program


the other reason, is i'm totally
programming not how i usually do
the font thing really threw me off
so i'm just being 


a good wizard always revels in a
conjuring

we'll get there

anyways! it's like a flip or flop
in settings




there might even be an event pas
ed means that my first plan worked
there is a function triggering
with a widget, an event and
it happens every time I click
on one of the enties
so now we flesh out moveFocus

I"ll just do it


Ok, so that worked perfectly

the last part was me saving
a workable release section

I try only to commit when every
thing is hunky dory, just good 
practice


ok, so what's happening now
is that the number is being stored
but not referenced. Easy enough fix!


that's easy enough
i thought it was an infinite loop
for a second

but it's just spawning a new window
for every single match of the lp
number


now I think it's changing the lp
variable

almost!



THAT COUNTS AS A HELL L YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE


ok, I think I"m going to call it
there for now, I code mainly
during the daytime.

I will be on tomorrow at noon! and
everyday if I can this month!


























Now we're setting up a new work
space! baahhahhaaha

no realy this one is cool, you
ll see

ok, so the cyberpunk theme is ni
ce, but the syntax highlighitn
should be hurled into the sun

I gotta change the theme,
vscodium
now it's the italics, everything
i do is monospaced

(when coding and not :P
we have a ok, now' to amp up
these bottom panels

That was a lesson in only working
on a profile after it's been nam
d otherwise the default override
